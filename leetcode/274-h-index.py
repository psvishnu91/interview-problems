"""274. H-Index

https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index

Algorithm: Sorting
--------â€“---------
- h index is the max number where the author has at least
    h papers of cited at least h times
- So let's sort the citations and
    * start with the paper with the maximum citations at the end.
        if this paper has 
        - citations[-1] == 0: then h-index has to be zero
            no papers have any citations
        - citations[-1] == 1: **h is exactly 1** 
            then highest num citations is
            1 and there's at least one paper with it, so
            h=1 (cannot be more). If h was higher
            say 2, then max citns, ie., citations[-1] needs
            to be at least 2.
        - citations[-1] > 1: h is at least 1, but possibly higher
    * next we go to index -2, if citations[-2]>=2 then there is
        at least 2 papers with citations>=2, so h is updated to 2
    * we keep going from the back and if citations[-i] >= i then
        h = i (at least i)
    * if we encounter a scenario where the invariant is broken
        say citations[-4] = 3, then there isn't 4 papers with
        at least 4 citations, h can be at most 3 and we break
        the loop.
